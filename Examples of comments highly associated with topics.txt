“An absolute disgrace to the Irish Health system! Patients on trolleys all down the corridor of A&E, bursting out the doors into the foyer area and actually holding fire doors open. Sick patients left sitting on the floor. Elderly patients treated like dirt. Witnessed two nurses. Chaos on wards. Staff walking around with no ID badges, they could be anyone. Security very lacking. No privacy in the wards, your full history is given out loud for all to hear. “

"Showers in the wards are filthy, not cleaned often enough - better to stay dirty than use them. Some staff are more interested in taking patients for a smoke than helping a guy with his meals. The grounds are full of smoke butts, filthy and this dump is called a hospital."

“No clear process or procedure. Nurses running around looking for equipment, dressings, gloves. Blood pressure equipment left uncharged or not functioning. The sequence of carrying out similar functions by different staff varied. The method of collection of data and recording of same is archaic. The layout of hospital and an efficient set of procedures are not compatible…An efficient management structure is non existent…”
 
”The A&E was awful. My father went in with a heart attack and was left in the waiting room for two hours. We went in at 4pm on a Friday evening and he didn't get a bed for over 24 hours. We met one nurse the whole time he was in A&E just to take bloods. He had an x-ray at 4am, 12 hrs after going in, was then left on a trolley all night long. He was stressed out, upset and couldn't sleep due to noise. One doctor who was around told him that there wasn't much that could be done for him”

“...this hospital is the filthiest I have ever encountered. I used a bathroom on the 4th floor of the old section of the hospital, and the work done by cleaning staff leaves a lot to be desired. There were cigarette butts on the windowsill, ash in the sink (so much for a smoking ban!) … The toilets themselves were in need of cleaning, and the bowls filthy. The hygiene checklist had of course been checked off for that day to indicate that the area had been cleaned, but in my opinion none of the cleaning had been completed in a while. Hygiene audit anyone?  "

“I found the cleanliness of my ward extremely poor and the toilet bathroom facilities were appalling - bins were overflowing. On one evening there was only one toilet working in the ward and that was absolutely filthy. The toilets that were out of order had been reported three days in a row but no plummer had come to fix them. It is unbelievable that by the morning of the third day, there were no toilets working on the ward. The parent room for tea coffee facilities is just filthy, outside of the fact that people do not clean up after themselves, there is not adequate spoons available and the cloth by the sink should be in the bin - I would consider this room more of a health risk than a facility. Overall I cannot believe the poor standard of hygiene on the Sunshine Ward and I would hope that does not set the standard for other areas of the hospital.”

 “My brother was brought to the A&E department in Our Lady's Hospital Navan by ambulance in the early hours of Saturday morning. He was an outpatient of Beaumont hospital for the 18 month duration of his battle with cancer and had not previously been seen in relation to this illness in Navan. Despite the early hour and lack of background in his illness, he was rapidly accessed including performance of a chest x-ray in the A&E department at approx 2:30am and he was diagnosed and admitted to ICU within 3 hours of admission to the hospital. At all times in A&E and ICU departments, his family were allowed stay with him and we only asked to leave the room when necessary for personal care examination. The care given to my brother in such a dignified manner and support shown to the whole family in a local hospital was so personal and was really appreciated at such a difficult time. "

"My GP referred my daughter for an x-ray following a fall on Monday. I had to leave after 4 hours to collect my other daughter and was told a doctor would ring me with the result of the x-ray. I am still waiting to establish whether my daughter has a break or a sprain. My GP has called the hospital-they would not disclose this information to my GP. It would appear that the motive behind St. Luke's A&E is to make the experience as difficult and as unpleasant as possible."

"My father was admitted with seizures associated with Alzheimer. There was a number of failings which I will bullet point briefly. 1. no clear explanation from medical staff the reasons for seizures. 2. my father was left in a chair slumped forward less than 24 hrs after seizure, dribbling, falling asleep whilst there was a newly made bed beside him.  3. he was prescribed anti seizure medication. my mother was not allowed to take him home as they wanted to monitor the new medication with his old meds my mother found his morning dose left in a pot on his locker not administered correctly. …"   

"My Dad was left in pain, and due to his condition, the staff didn't even try to communicate with him (a rare brain disease). He was transferred to a ward where, while he was dying, maintenance was carrying out repairs on the ceiling next to him, and just because the curtains were pulled, the staff thought it was ok. The sick and dying are very vulnerable and only that we demanded a palliative room, my Dad wouldn't have been moved, just left to die in pain on a ward with maintenance work going on. Horrendous treatment of a person."

“Had a bad breakage one evening so had no choice but to go to A&E. 12 hours waiting and I still had not been seen by a doctor. Was checked by triage nurse after about 30 minutes. …. In the next 11 and a half hours I was not seen. After 12 hours I was informed by the very helpful lady in reception that there were still five people in front of me to see the doctor and that when I would finally see the doctor I should expect to wait another three to four hours for an X-ray.”.  
 
"Waited in A&E for seven hours. My partner was in severe pain, he saw a triage nurse 10 minutes after arrival. … We arrived at 11pm and at 5am he still had not been called to be seen by a doctor. I understand A&E can be busy and emergencies prioritised, but surely patients could be told that there is a delay”

“Coming off the boat from France in Rosslare, my wife had a very sore eye, we were not sure what to do. As Irish living abroad we were quite apprehensive about the hospitals in Ireland, but had to go to A+E anyway in Wexford. We were pleasantly surprised with the friendliness, efficiency and speed with which we were dealt with. With 4 kids under 11, the speed was important! We've had similar experience in other public hospitals, but only, up until now, in .... France. Keep up the good work”

"Falls well below the standard one would expect of a private hospital in 2018. Clearly there has been little if any investment in the building since it was taken over. Three beds crammed in to a tiny room with no air conditioning, no en-suite facilities and with furniture that is well overdue for the skip. While clean, the rooms and corridors are tatty. They charged ?1,000 for 3.5 hours so they can and should do better."

“My treatment was a disgrace. I was not listened to, my symptoms weren't believed and I was sent home with no plan of treatment, no investigations done and no support whatsoever. How can a doctor rule out that I have an illness if no tests are done? Does the doctor have X-ray eyes? I waited 1.5 years for this appointment and it was of no use at all. “

“My daughter has a serious condition and I insisted that she was covered by a really good health plan and that it was imperative for us, and other patients, that she get a private room. We were sent to a side room off A&E for hours. They informed us a room was ready and we were taken to a six-bed public ward. I'm afraid I lost the plot and insisted they take us back down to the A&E room we were in, at least it was private. Due to her condition, a lot of the ward noise was upsetting her. I know we hit hospital at peak of flu season, but no-one could even be bothered to come talk to us and listen to why it was imperative that my daughter had a private room.”

“I found many nurses are not trained to handle old people and treat them as bold children ("you must get more sleep", to someone in agony trying to catch their breath). My worst experience was two nurses clamping a full face mask on and then pulling the adjustment straps so tight that they hurt my ears and nearly strangled me. Only when I ripped off the mask and protested very loudly did they stop. After a day or two I learned how to put on the mask myself, but after that I was labelled a "difficult patient" and treated accordingly. After 13 days it became obvious that some nurses are not, and never will be, fit to be nurses. They should be weeded out by yearly tests.”

Diagnosis x-rays etc were really quick, blood tests etc My dad was kept in for two nights. Outstanding service and follow up. 

“The service I received was prompt, extremely efficient and very professional and all staff members involved in my care were friendly, informative and reassuring. There was a problem with the IT system at the time of my appointment which meant a delay in services however the staff kept all the patients informed and updated, and went so far as to make tea and coffee for anyone who wanted it and also produced a tin of chocolate sweets.”

It is my view my mother's subsequent death was as a result of minor hand surgery and subsequent misdiagnosis and the inappropriate treatment with enemas which lead to small bowel failure and acute pancreatitis.“

“Disgusting. Leaking urine bag. Patient left exposed on a number of occasions in a public ward. A nurse warned of a risk of meningitis infection and when questioned an hour later said that there was no meningitis. Contradictory advice given over 2 week period. There seemed to be a lack of standardized approach. We were poorly informed on almost every level. CUH offers great acute care and fails completely on a nursing level.

“I had my first baby in here nine months ago. I think it was probably the most upsetting experience you could imagine. I was told one thing by one doctor and something else by another. In the end I was induced and ended up as a c-section. When baby was born I ended up in intensive care overnight while my baby went to maternity. I had spoken to doctors about my concern on how big I was and asked repeatedly was the baby getting very big...I was told no he was not and I was just being paranoid. My baby weighed almost 12 pounds. Thanks to the lovely midwives who lifted my spirits and helped me out so much after he was born. As for the care and info I received from the doctors beforehand, I would definitely think about getting my care from another maternity hospital.”

“I thought this hospital was disgusting, dirt everywhere. From floors to walls, everything in this hospital was covered in dirt. The staff were rude and had a superior attitude about themselves. I noticed surgeons walking around in their scrubs ready for theatre, shouldn't theatre be a sterile environment? I had to have five different types of antibiotics and doctors wanted to treat me with penicillin regardless of the fact I was allergic to it and wearing a bright read bracket with this stated on it. Staff messed up giving me a needle five times and caused my arm to bleed into the bed twice and just shrugged about it. Staff need to go back to school and re-learn how to care for people”

“The staff were uneducated, medieval, backward. The patients are just fodder for their inefficient machine. The trauma still haunts me to this day. I still have the many scars that will never be erased and on top of that, I had the trauma of listening to others suffer. I remember a very young patient being made to cry in the middle of the night by a evil, evil nurse, that will never leave me. To this day I wonder if that patient is alright.

The second time he was told to come in as his face was so swollen the first time, they couldn't do anything. He arrived at 9am and was not seen until 12.  They said that he should have had surgery days ago and were giving out that he didn't come in sooner. He told them that he was told to come in this day and did not know that he would need surgery.

He tried to call a nurse but no joy as his speech is gone from the stroke, It's just disgusting ! No dignaty at all, they don't think he will have a bed for another two days, he cannot swallow properly and he's given meals and left to eat alone in case he chokes“

Yes max they will charge you on the day is ?600 plus whatever they can screw your VHI for. However it doesn't end there. If you have a fracture and have to come back you will need to take out a bank loan to keep up with consultation fees, x-rays, split charges, physio etc etc... Your insurance won't pay any of this directly. Please consider this before you are left in debt. I think it's a money making machine plain and simple. The most efficient dept there seems to be finance who will bombard you with calls and threatening letters. Even when they have billed you in error. Beware. If you think it's a broken bone, please do yourself a favour and go to the public hospital where the aftercare us included in your initial fee. …”

The person who attended me did not wear a hospital tunic but a t-shirt with no name tag attached. Procedure was not explained to me and the attendant was continually conversing with their colleagues at the back of the room about sporting events the previous weekend. Very unprofessional.”
 
“I have had several extremely poor experiences including being told to 'google it' when I asked how my cysts were to be treated. I was also kicked out of A&E at 3am after being told throughout the day and night that I would be getting a bed in a ward. I had to sit in a reclining chair until 7am when my wife could come and pick me up. I was also given two different names for the doctor that I wanted to make a complaint about. Waiting times are a joke and the doctors don't seem to care one bit about their patients (the nurses were some bit professional). I would never recommend this hospital to anyone I care about. “
